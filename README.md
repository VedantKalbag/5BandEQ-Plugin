# 5BandEQ-Plugin
Here I've built my first audio plugin that has a 5 band parametric EQ with adjustable centre frequency, Q and gain. 
This project was built using JUCE 6 and can be built using the Projucer app available here: https://juce.com/get-juce

## Future Work:
Add in a selection for filter type for low and high bands
Calibrate Q range
